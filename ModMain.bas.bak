'  4) Num particles per second:    Number of particles emitted per second.
'  5) Particle Life:    Each particle lives this long (in seconds).
'  6) Damping:          How much particle's speed is lost due to friction.
'  7) Gravity strength: Effect of gravity. (Negative values make the particles float upwards.)
'  8) Turbulance size:  Size of random turbulance (in meters)
'  9) Turbulance strength: How much a particle is affected by turbulance.
''''
' 10,11) Alpha keys :    Each attribute is controlled by two keys and
' 12,13) Red keys   :    each key has two fields: (time, magnitude)
' 14,15) Green keys :    For example scale key (0.3,0.6) means
' 16,17) Blue keys  :    scale of each particle will be 0.6 at the
' 18,19) Scale keys :    time 0.3 (where time=0 means creation and time=1 means end of the particle)
'
' The magnitudes are interpolated in between the two keys and remain constant beyond the keys.
' Except the alpha always starts from 0 at time 0.
''''
' 20) Emit Box Size :   The dimension of the box particles are emitted from.
' 21) Emit velocity :   Particles are initially shot with this velocity.
' 22) Emit dir randomness
' 23) Particle rotation speed: Particles start to rotate with this (angular) speed (degrees per second).
' 24) Particle rotation damping: How quickly particles stop their rotation
